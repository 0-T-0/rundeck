This project is a simple set of java classes.

It illustrates what Maven can do for a developer with the addition of
a single file - project.xml

To try it out:
- Make sure Maven is installed on your machine
- change to this directory (e.g. cd "Program Files\Maven\examples\simple-java" )
- Try some Maven goals:
	maven jar (builds a jar file)
	maven site (creates a web site of documentation based on the project)
etc...

For a full list of goals, use:

	maven -g
