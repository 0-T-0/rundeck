      <p>
        A successful project requires many people to play many roles.
        Some members write code or documentation, while others are
        valuable as testers, submitting patches and suggestions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team is comprised of <a href="#Members">Members</a>
        and <a href="#Contributors">Contributors</a>.  Members 
        have direct access to the source of a project and actively
        evolve the code-base.  Contributors improve the project
        through submission of patches and suggestions to the Members.
        The number of Contributors to the project is unbounded.
        Get involved today.  All contributions to the project are
        greatly appreciated.
