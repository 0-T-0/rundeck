            When you are <code>online</code>, this goal generates developer
            and file activity reports. The developer report gives you a list of
            the developers for your project and a commit count for the period.
            The file report gives you a list of changed files, sorted by commit
            count.
            <br />
            These reports rely on the <code>repository</code> element in your
            <code>project.xml</code> and are currently available for CVS and
            Subversion.
