  <section name="Futures">
    <p>
    The following is a list of things that are being contemplated
    for the Maven J2EE Plug-in.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add support for external jars in the EAR target (ATM, the only solution
        is to copy them with a callback in ${maven.build.dir} and they will
        be placed at the root level of the EAR file. We also need to have
        Class-Path entries in generated J2EE EJB jars and such. Quite tricky
        as it doesn't work the same for all application servers (and across
        versions of them !).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add HTML validation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add EAR validation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add validation of Tag libraries to the war target.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add technology specific validators, e.g. JSP/Turbine/Velocity/Struts
        etc
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow integration with a 'webserver' plugin so that application server
        requests can seamlessly be hooked into the application server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tie where applicable the appserver instance to other Maven plugins that
        need an application server instance to do their work.
      </li>
   </ol>
