    <section name="Rationale">
      <p>
        Having a common directory layout would allow for users familiar
        with one Maven project to immediately feel at home in another
        Maven project. The advantages are analogous to adopting a
        site-wide look-and-feel. Common Maven procedures strengthen the
        Maven brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next two sections document the directory layout expected by
        Maven and the directory layout created by Maven.  Please try to
        conform to this structure as much as possible; however, if you
        must these settings can be overridden via properties as
        documented in the <a
        href="../../start/integrate.html#Properties">Integration</a> document.

          <td>
            This directory is used by the Clover Plug-in as a placeholder for
            the instrumented code and also as the location of the Clover
            database.

            Clover generates its HTML reports in this directory.
