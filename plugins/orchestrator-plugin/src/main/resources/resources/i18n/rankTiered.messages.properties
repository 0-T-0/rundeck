plugin.title=Rank Tiered
plugin.description=Process nodes tiered by rank.\n\
\n\
Will never process the next rank until all nodes in the \
previous rank are complete. \
Uses the configured Rank ordering for the Job.\n\
\n\
**Note**: if a *Rank Attribute* is not set, then the node \
names are used as the rank attribute, and the behavior of \
this orchestrator will essentially be single threaded.
